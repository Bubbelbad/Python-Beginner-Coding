# Python-Beginner-Coding

This is where I'll be uploading my first lines of code on my way to learning Python. 
It'll be quite basic for a while but you're welcome to give me some tips and tricks if ye like!
Some of the code is mine and some are from exercices from different sources, such as codecademy.
